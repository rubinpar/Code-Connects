# HW:
# 1. Print the odd numbers between 0 and 40 using variables to store 40
#      and some kind of loop
#      (2 different ways, maybe using range, for loop, a while loop)
# 2. Add your two favorite numbers and then print the remainder when you divide
#    that sum by your age. For example, if your favorite numbers were 1 and 2
#    and you were 2 years old, you would print the number 1.
#    Remember to use varaibles.
