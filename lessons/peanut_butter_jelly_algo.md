# Algorithms
Algorithms have an input, a process, and then an output. It might be important to think about errors during the algorithm. 

Pseudo-code: English that is step by step and tells us how to write it into Python (or other progamming languages). 
What we actually want the code to accomplish. 

## PBJ Sandwich Algorithm Psuedo-code:

**Input:** Bread, Peanut Butter, Jelly

**Process**:
1. Go to the kitchen. 
2. I open the cabinet. 
3. I get the loaf of bread out. 
  * If there is no bread, ERROR!
4. Get a knife.
5. Get a plate. 
  * Go to Cabinet B. 
  * Open Cabinet B.
  * Get a white plate from the bottom shelf. 
  * Close Cabinet B.
6. Retrieve the peanut butter.
  * Our robot knows how to do this!
7. Retrieve the jelly. 
8. Get a piece of bread out.
9. Dip the knife into the peanut butter. 
10. Spread onto one slice of bread. 
11. Dip the knife into jelly.
12. Spread onto another slice of bread. 
13. Close the sandwich.
  * Our robot knows how to do this because we taught it before! Another algorithm!
14. Put away all materials.
15. Enjoy!

**Output:** peanut butter jelly sandwich!
